## **Project Features**  

### **Programming Languages**  
- Python  
- SQL  

### **Tools Used**  
- **Anaconda** & **EDM** in Visual Studio Code  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis  
- Machine learning workflows with **scikit-learn**  
- **Tableau** for complementary visualizations  

### **Highlights**  
- Building an image classification pipeline using CNN models like ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.  
- Analyzing model performance to identify areas for optimization.  
- Exploring the applications of generative AI in marketing and predictive modeling.
