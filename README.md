# **Machine Learning Project**  
**Part of the AWS/Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**  
---
## **Overview**  
- This project is part of the **AWS/Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**, initially designed by Computer Scientist **Jenner Staab.**
  The main focus is to develop an **image classification pipeline** that identifies whether or not images are of dogs, classifies their breed, and 
  evaluates the performance of three CNN models: **ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG**.  
  While the focus is on image classification, the lessons learned and skills gained provide practical insights that extend and or apply to fields like
  **Marketing Analytics and Data Science,** enabling AI/ML to enhance decision-making and generate actionable insights.  
---
### Objectives:
1. **Classify Images**: Determine whether the provided images are of dogs and, if so, classify their breed.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Compare and assess the performance of the ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG models.
3. **Resource Optimization**: Evaluate time and resource requirements for each model and determine if alternative solutions could yield similar results efficiently.
4. **Extend Learning**: Apply insights from classification techniques to projects in **data-driven marketing and analytics.**
---
### **Project Features** :
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL.
- **Tools Used**:
  - Visual Studio Code with Anaconda.
  - scikit-learn for machine learning workflows.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis  
- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Gained hands-on experience in **image classification**.
  - Explored **generative AI** and predictive modeling techniques for broader analytics goals.
  - Improved understanding of time-efficient algorithms for large-scale data handling.
