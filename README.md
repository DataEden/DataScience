Machine Learning
Part of the AWS/Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

Overview
This project was developed as part of the AWS/Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree, originally designed by Computer Scientist Jenner S. The primary focus is on building and analyzing an image classification pipeline using machine learning to classify pet images and measure model performance.

While the project focuses on image classification, the techniques and methodologies applied directly influence my broader exploration into marketing data science, where I aim to use AI/ML to derive actionable insights and enhance decision-making processes.
